# Warm-up Exercise Project Delegation Guide

## Project Overview
In this assignment, we are embarking on a small warm-up exercise to code a web widget using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose is to explore programming concepts and derisk potential problems in the final project. You have three options to choose from, each increasing in complexity:

1. **Sentiment Rating Widget**: Similar to the one demonstrated in class.
2. **Task List (Journal Entries)**: Read data from hardcoded JSON files to create a task list.
3. **Calendar for Navigation**: An interface of a calendar with clickable days.

Your primary focus should be on code quality, user experience, including tests, documentation, and other aspects of well-engineered code. At the completion of the sprint, you'll demonstrate your app in a short YouTube video, provide access to the working app for your TA mentor, and conduct a SWOT analysis of your learnings from the exercise.

## Expected Outcomes
1. Implementation of at least one of the three widgets.
2. SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) on team, tech, and tool aspects, along with a brief summary of your learning.
3. Submission requirements for GRADESCOPE, including a PDF containing team details, GitHub repo link, YouTube link, and full SWOT analysis.

## Project Delegation Steps

1. **Ensure Access to Organization and Clone Repository**:
   - Make sure you have access to our organization on GitHub.
   - Clone the `warmup-exercise` repository to your local machine.

2. **Decide Widget Component**:
   - Discuss with your team and decide which widget component you want to build.
   - Consider the complexity and your team's strengths when making the decision.

3. **Create a New Branch**:
   - Create a new branch for yourself within the repository to work on your chosen component.
   - Use a clear and descriptive branch name, such as `sentiment-widget` or `calendar-navigation`.

4. **Component Development and Documentation**:
   - Begin developing your chosen widget component using standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Create a Markdown (MD) file serving as usage documentation for your component.
   - Document the functionality, usage instructions, and any additional information necessary for others to understand and use your component effectively.

5. **Add Files and Commit Changes**:
   - Add your developed files and the MD documentation file to the repository.
   - Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages.

6. **Push to Origin and Accept PR**:
   - Push your branch with the changes to the remote repository (origin).
   - Create a pull request (PR) for your branch and assign it to the appropriate team member for review.
   - After review and necessary revisions, accept the PR to merge your changes into the main branch.

## Additional Notes
- If you're attempting multiple widgets, keep them in separate folders within the `warmup-exercise` repository.
- Consider breaking your team into smaller groups to tackle each widget component efficiently.
- Regularly share thoughts and provide feedback to each other throughout the process to ensure smooth progress.
